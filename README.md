# Draft FreeBSD Git docs

This repo contains the draft docs for the FreeBSD migration to Git.

The best place to start is with the mini-primer.md if you are coming to this fresh. Otherwise the best place to start is src-cvt.md if you have an existing source tree from the project you'd like to convert over to the new git repo. Once you've read that, you can read mini-primer.md for a general primer.

More advanced topics can be found in the FAQ.md.

The other files contain inforamtion about different aspects of the src or doc repository that FreeBSD developers with commit access need to know.

Please feel free to submit pull requests for typos, clearer language, additional
topics, etc.

Please open issues for something that you're just noting the problem, but
don't have a solution for.
